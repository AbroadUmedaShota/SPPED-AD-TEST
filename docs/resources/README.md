# Resources Directory

This folder centralises non-code reference material that accompanies the mock dashboard.

## Subdirectories
- `client-materials/reference-docs/`: Raw documents supplied by the client team (meeting logs, spreadsheets, requirement notes). Filenames keep their original encoding so refer to the accompanying project documentation when in doubt.
- `forms/legacy-submissions/`: Archived application forms and ZIP bundles previously stored under `06_other/`. Treat these as read-only evidence when discussing historical flows.

If a file is needed by the product experience, move a copy into `02_dashboard/assets/` and document the dependency. Otherwise, keep reference-only artefacts in this directory or under `archive/`.
