# Guides

Reference notes and AI-facing handbooks imported from the dashboard workspace.

## Contents
- `AGENTS.md`: Repository working agreement sourced from the agent onboarding flow.
- `AI_Message.md`: Concise reminder for generated AI status updates.
- `GEMINI.md`: Primary operating manual for the Gemini assistant (long-form instructions).
- `GEMINI.placeholder.md`: Empty placeholder retained from the original root for backward compatibility.
- `local_development_plan.md`: Step-by-step local environment checklist for human developers.

Add new playbooks or assistant guides here to keep the project root focused on runtime assets.
