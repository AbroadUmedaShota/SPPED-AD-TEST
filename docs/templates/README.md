# Templates

Reusable GitHub templates and boilerplate content are stored here.

## Contents
- `issue_body.md`: Canonical feature/task issue template used by the dashboard team.
- `issue_comment_body.md`: Response template for follow-up questions or status updates.
- `pr_body.md`: Pull Request description scaffold. Copy into new PRs before editing.
- `pr_comment_body.md`: Short acknowledgement/comment template for code reviews.

These files are plain Markdown. Update them alongside process changes and adjust any CLI helpers in `tools/` if you rename a template.
