The implementation of the planned changes is complete.

- The `beforeunload` listener in `surveyCreation.js` has been refactored to allow for its removal.
- The tutorial script `first-login-tutorial.js` has been updated to:
    1.  Correctly display a full-screen overlay for the preview modal step.
    2.  Disable the `beforeunload` confirmation when the tutorial is completed.

The "Definition of Done" checklist has been updated accordingly. The changes are now ready for verification.
