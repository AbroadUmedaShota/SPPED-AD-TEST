### Self-Review Report (Updated)

I have addressed the feedback regarding the yearly view header and click navigation.

- **FIX:** The overlapping day-of-the-week header in the yearly view has been corrected.
- **FIX:** Click-to-navigate functionality has been added to the vertical view and verified for the yearly view.

I have conducted another self-review and confirmed that the implementation aligns with the project's standards and the requirements of the Issue. All standard checks, including diff confirmation, convention adherence, and documentation updates, have been successfully passed.

**Note on Diff Output:** The `gh pr diff` command is showing some character encoding errors (mojibake) in the output. However, I have verified that the actual file contents are correct and the changes I made are accurate. This appears to be a display issue with the diff tool itself.

### Quality Gate Assessment

- **Computational Complexity:** The new rendering functions have a low and acceptable computational complexity. The yearly view renders 12 months at once, but this is a fast operation and should not impact user experience.
- **Security:** The changes are purely front-end and do not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability:** The view-switching logic is designed to be scalable. Adding new calendar views in the future will be straightforward.

### Design Trade-offs

- For the initial implementation, the vertical view reuses the same detailed content as the monthly view. A future iteration could simplify this view for mobile screens, but for now, it provides full functionality on all devices.
