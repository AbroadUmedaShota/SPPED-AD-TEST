This commit introduces the foundational elements for multilingual support within the application.

- **New Documentation:** Added initial planning and requirements documents for multilingualization under `docs/99.多言語化対応にむけて/`.
- **Core Feature Changes:** Modified `02_dashboard/surveyCreation.html`, `data/sample_survey.json`, `src/surveyCreation.js`, and `src/ui/surveyRenderer.js` to support dynamic content loading and rendering for multiple languages.
- **Project Documentation:** Updated `docs/00_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` and `docs/01_ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the inclusion of multilingual capabilities and their architectural implications.
- **Repository Setup:** Added `.gitignore` and `README.md` for proper version control and project overview.
