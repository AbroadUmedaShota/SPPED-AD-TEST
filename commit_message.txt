feat(fab): add floating action button to survey creation page

Re-implements the floating action button (FAB) for adding questions and question groups on the survey creation page.

- Removes the old, non-functional drag-and-drop logic for the previous floating menu.
- Creates a new, modular FAB component (`fab.html`, `fab.js`).
- Dynamically loads the FAB component into the survey creation page.

This change resolves issue #12 by providing a clean, user-friendly interface for adding questions, in line with the current application architecture.
