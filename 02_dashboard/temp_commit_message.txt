fix: Resolve JavaScript syntax error and update survey creation spec

This commit addresses the `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` in `src/surveyCreation.js` by removing duplicate event listener blocks.

Additionally, the `docs/specifications/02_survey_creation.md` document has been updated to reflect the current understanding of the survey creation and editing page's functionality based on code analysis.

Note: Ongoing work to resolve `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')` related to missing DOM elements in `surveyCreation.html` and incorrect `setupEventListeners` call in `src/surveyCreation.js` is still in progress. The HTML modification for `addQuestionGroupBtn` is being handled manually due to `replace` tool limitations.
