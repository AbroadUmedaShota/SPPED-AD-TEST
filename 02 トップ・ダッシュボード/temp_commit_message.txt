feat: Implement and refine dashboard UI features

This commit introduces several UI enhancements and fixes based on recent requirements:

- **Survey List Actions:**
    - "Copy Survey" icon now copies the survey URL to clipboard.
    - "Edit Survey" icon in the list now shows an "unimplemented" toast, indicating future navigation to a dedicated edit screen.
    - "Delete Survey" icon now shows an "unimplemented" toast.
- **Survey Details Modal:**
    - Implemented basic view/edit mode toggle.
    - Ensured existing data populates edit fields correctly.
    - Converted 'Plan', 'Bizcard Enabled', and 'Thank You Email Settings' to dropdowns for editing.
    - Fixed data download button functionality.
    - Marked 'Data Completion Date', 'Download Deadline', and 'Estimated Billing Amount' as display-only (non-editable).
- **UI/Layout Improvements:**
    - Fixed floating label text overlap by adopting a "Raised Label" style across all input fields.
    - Stabilized main content area position during sidebar open/close by making the sidebar an overlay.
    - Adjusted column widths in the survey list table for better visual alignment.
- **Error Handling & Unimplemented Features:**
    - Added toast notifications for various unimplemented features (e.g., logout, new survey creation, data download, account info save, group management, contact form submission).
    - Resolved a `SyntaxError` in `script.js` caused by duplicated code.
- **Documentation Updates:**
    - Updated `Issue/design_guideline.md` to reflect the new "Raised Label" style.
    - Updated `Issue/screen_requirements.md`, `Issue/ui_messages.md`, and `Issue/screen_flow.md` to align with the implemented changes and feature statuses.
