# Dashboard Data

This directory houses canonical mock data for the dashboard UI.

- `core/` – shared lookups used across pages (surveys, groups, users, invoices).
- `surveys/` – survey definitions and metadata (including `enquete/`).
- `responses/` – per-survey responses and business card data.
- `demos/` – optional demo datasets used for sample pages and charts.

Large archival dumps have been moved to `archive/data-dumps/` to keep runtime assets light.
